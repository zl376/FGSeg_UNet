# Foreground Segmentation using 2D Convolutional Neural Network: U-Net

Reference: [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-24574-4_28)

## Use in command line
Example: `python3 FGSeg.py -i input_filename -o output_maskname`

It requires pre-calculated weights as in models/weights_optimal.h5
